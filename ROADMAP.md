# Fakeamon — Development Roadmap 🗺️

A **step-by-step build plan** for Jeff & Lewis. Each step is small, and after
almost every step you can **open the game and see something new**. That's the
whole idea: build a little, play it, then build the next little bit.

> **How to read this:** Big sections are **Milestones (M1–M5)**. Inside each
> milestone are **numbered steps**, named **`MxSy`** — M‹milestone›S‹step›, so
> M3's 7th step is **M3S7**. That's the same S-numbering the `PLANS/` docs use,
> so a step has **one name everywhere** (this file, `roadmap.html`, the plans,
> `CLAUDE.md`). Every step says what we build and, in **▶ You'll see:**, what
> shows up on screen when it works.
>
> **Source of truth:** `DESIGN.md` (the full plan). This roadmap is the
> *order we do things in*. If a step and DESIGN.md ever disagree, DESIGN.md wins.

## The golden rules (how we build)

1. **One small step at a time.** Finish a step, play it, then move on.
2. **Keep it runnable.** The game should open and work after every step.
3. **Numbers live in obvious spots.** HP, power, catch rate — all easy to find
   and tweak (Lewis's experiments!).
4. **Commit after each working step**, with a plain message like
   `"growler can now use Flare"`.
5. **Stay in scope.** If a step starts dragging in a *later* milestone, stop
   and flag it.
6. **Tick both trackers, same commit — and recount the totals.** This file
   and `roadmap.html` (the live quest map) show the same steps two ways.
   Whenever a step is finished **or** the step list changes (adding, moving,
   or removing a step), update `roadmap.html` in the *same commit*, and
   recompute **every derived number**, not just the ✅ marks:
   - the **overall** header — `X / Y steps · Milestone N of 5` and its meter
     `width:` — where **X = steps marked done across all milestones**,
     **Y = total steps**, and the meter width is `X / Y` as a percent;
   - each milestone's **`N of M steps done`** line and its zone-meter `width:`.

   This is the rule's whole point: the header counter drifted **twice** —
   Steps 3–4 shipped here but not there (2026-07-06), and later M2's overall
   count sat at `12` after all 6 M2 steps were done (should've been `14`,
   caught 2026-07-08). The per-zone "6 of 6" was right both times; the
   **overall** line is the one that gets forgotten. When in doubt, recount
   all five zones from scratch and re-add them.

   **✅ The recurring check (do this every time, don't rely on memory):** after
   any step change, run

   ```bash
   node tools/check-roadmap.mjs
   ```

   It recomputes every count straight from the actual done-marks (`class="done"`
   in `roadmap.html`, `✅` in this file), checks the meters, and **fails if the
   two files disagree or any counter is wrong.** It must print `✅ PASS` before
   you commit a step change — that's what turns "keep both roadmaps current"
   from a thing you remember into a thing the tooling enforces. (The naming
   scheme it assumes: one row per **`MxSy`** step — see "How to read this" above.)
7. **Peer-review checkpoint at each milestone boundary.** Before starting a
   new milestone, get an *outside/expert* pair of eyes on the **next**
   milestone's design and roadmap — a deep-research / Fable research-mode
   pass is a good fit (external, cited, benchmarked). **Use the ready-made
   prompt template in `MODELS.md`** ("The Peer-Review Checkpoint"). It's a
   ritual, like the Model Huddle, **not** a numbered step (it doesn't change
   the counter). Keep it to these rules:
   - **Scope it** to what's decided or about to be built — not speculative
     later milestones.
   - **Hold it to our teaching constraints.** Plain, readable, no-build,
     kid-friendly. A reviewer who says "add TypeScript, a bundler, an ECS,
     a test framework" is fighting the whole point — accept such advice only
     with eyes open, and mark it "much later, optional."
   - **Pair it with a code pass.** Deep research judges *design*, not code
     correctness — run the local `/code-review` on the real files for bugs.
   - **Fold accepted findings in** through the normal Decision loop
     (`DECISIONS.md`).
   - **First checkpoint: now, before M3 S1** — the M2→M3 Phaser handoff is the
     riskiest step, so it's cheapest to de-risk on paper. Run one at every
     later boundary too, when there's a playable slice to critique.

## How to run the game

**Easiest — play it live, no setup:** [jhester599.github.io/fakeamon_spark](https://jhester599.github.io/fakeamon_spark/)
(auto-deployed from `main` on every push, always current).

**Or run it locally:**

```bash
# from the project folder
python3 -m http.server
# then visit http://localhost:8000 in a browser
```

Or double-click `index.html`. (When we reach M3 and add a map with **Phaser**,
this section gets updated.)

---

## ✅ M1 — Battle Slice  *(complete! 🎉 M2 is next)*

**Goal:** one full turn-based fight — **Growler vs Whaley**. Pick a move,
deal damage, HP drops, someone faints, win/lose screen. Nothing else.

**Bonus, ahead of schedule:** all 3 starters — Growler, Whaley, and Leafick —
now show real Tuxemon-based art (`assets/sprites/growler.png` / `whaley.png`
/ `leafick.png`) instead of colored boxes — see `CREDITS.md`. The rest of
the roster's art (mini-bosses, gyms, evolutions) is still planned for **M3
Step 3** below, once Phaser is in and we need proper sprite-sheet slicing
for the overworld anyway.

A good fight lasts about **3–5 hits per side**, misses are **rare**, and
**type advantage clearly matters**.

| Step | What we build | ▶ You'll see |
|---|---|---|
| **1** ✅ | Show both fighters with stats + moves (placeholder colored boxes) | Growler & Whaley side by side — *done!* |
| **2** ✅ | Add a **move button** for each of Growler's moves, and a **text battle log** under the arena | Four buttons; clicking one writes "Growler used Flare!" in the log — *done!* |
| **3** ✅ | The **damage formula**: `raw = power + attack − defense` (min 1). Clicking a move lowers Whaley's HP number | Whaley's HP number drops when you attack — *done!* |
| **4** ✅ | **HP bars** — a colored bar that shrinks as HP falls | Green/yellow/red bars that visibly shrink — *done!* |
| **5** ✅ | Add **type multiplier** + the small **random wiggle** (×0.85–1.15) so damage varies and Fire-vs-Water feels different | "It's not very effective…" vs bigger hits; damage jitters a little each time — *done!* |
| **6** ✅ | **Whaley fights back** with a random move, and **turn order by Speed** (ties go to the player) | A real back-and-forth: you hit, then Whaley hits — *done!* |
| **7** ✅ | **Accuracy / misses** — roll each move; a miss does nothing that turn (rare) | Occasionally "…but it missed!" appears — *done!* |
| **8** ✅ | **Fainting + win/lose screen** + a **Play Again** button | At 0 HP a Fakeamon faints and a win/lose message shows — *done!* |

**🎉 M1 done when:** you can play a whole Growler-vs-Whaley battle in the
browser, moves sometimes miss, type advantage is obvious, and fights last a
few hits each.

---

## ✅ M2 — Catching & Team  *(complete! 🎉 all 6 steps + save v1 + export/import)*

**Goal:** turn a one-off fight into "catch creatures and build a team."

> **🧩 New since planning:** `PLANS/M5_STATE_AND_SAVE_PLAN.md` §6 schedules
> state-foundation work *into* M2: the `startBattle` contract lands with
> Steps 3–4, "individuals & the state bag" lands **before Step 5**, and
> save v1 + export/import land at the **end of M2**. Read that plan's §A
> before starting Step 3 — it maps the plans onto our global-script style.
> **Status (2026-07-10):** Steps 1–6 below AND the M5-plan follow-ups **S3
> (save v1 — autosave + Continue/New Game)** and **S4 (export/import)** are
> all done — so M2 is fully wrapped. (These two aren't numbered rows here, so
> the step counter stays 14/31; they're the "still to come" items the plan
> folded into M2.) On to **M3** — its **S1** is already done (see the M3
> section + `PLANS/M3_OVERWORLD_PLAN.md` §A.5).

| Step | What we build | ▶ You'll see |
|---|---|---|
| **1** ✅ | Split game code into small files: `src/data/moves.js`, `src/data/fakeamon.js`, `src/data/typechart.js`, plus `src/battle.js`. Same game, tidier code | Game plays exactly the same — just easier to read and grow — *done!* |
| **2** ✅ | Add the third starter **Leafick** (Grass) to the data, and a simple **"Choose your starter"** screen | Pick Growler, Whaley, or Leafick before the fight — *done!* |
| **3** ✅ | A **wild Fakeamon** appears (pick a random one to fight) instead of always Whaley | Different opponents each battle — *done!* |
| **4** ✅ | Add the **Catch** action + a **Fakeaball**, using the capture formula (50% base chance, better at low HP — Lewis's call) | A "Throw Fakeaball" button; sometimes "Gotcha! …was caught!" — *done!* |
| **5** ✅ | A **team list** — caught Fakeamon join your party, up to **4 active** (Lewis's call). A 5th catch goes to your **Boxes** | A row of up to 4 creatures below the battle, plus a Boxes screen for overflow — *done!* |
| **6** ✅ | **Switch** which Fakeamon is fighting, including swapping one in from your Boxes | A "Switch" button swaps in a teammate — *done! Switch works two ways: mid-battle (costs your turn, same speed-order risk as any other action) and between encounters from the team screen (free, since no fight's happening)* |

**🎉 M2 done when:** you can fight a wild Fakeamon, weaken it, catch it, and
see it join a team you can swap between.

> **✅ Two small follow-ups on Step 4 (catching) — decided 2026-07-10, built
> 2026-07-22:**
> 1. **Limited Fakeaballs.** Start with **5**; each throw (catch or miss)
>    uses one from `gameState.inventory.balls.fakeaball`; the "Throw
>    Fakeaball" button shows the live count and disables at **zero**. Tall
>    Tower purchases (M4 Step 3) add more to the same count.
> 2. **Pause after a catch.** A successful catch now shows a **Continue**
>    button (like a battle win/lose does) instead of resolving straight
>    into a new battle, so the "Gotcha!" message has a beat before the
>    screen changes.
>
> See `DECISIONS.md` #49–50 and `DESIGN.md` §6/§9 for the full decisions.
> Doesn't have its own M2 step number — M2's table above stays the
> historical record of what Step 4 originally shipped.

---

## ✅ M3 — Overworld (the map)  *(complete! 🎉 all 11 steps — on to M4)*

**Goal:** walk around a world and bump into wild Fakeamon. This is where we
bring in **Phaser** (a game engine that handles tile maps and movement).

> **📐 M3 is numbered `M3S1…M3S11`, matching `PLANS/M3_OVERWORLD_PLAN.md` §9.**
> The rows below **are** those steps — the roadmap and the plans finally share
> one numbering. (This replaced an older, confusing scheme where a single row
> bundled several S-steps, e.g. one row covered both S3 and S4.) **M3S1–M3S10
> are the plan's S1–S10; M3S11 (expand the wild roster) is content work
> *beyond* the core plan** — the plan left the roster for "later," so it's its
> own step here; in practice it lands right after battles work (M3S7/S8), and
> it's numbered last only because it was added after the plan. Build from the
> plans; this table is the short version.
>
> **Status (M3 complete 2026-07-12 · M4 peer-review checkpoint 2026-07-22):**
> all 11 M3 steps are done — Phaser's in, the meadow renders, you walk it with
> an animated hero (keyboard or the "Pocket Venta" touch D-pad), wild Fakeamon
> idle in the grass, **walking into one opens the real battle** and returns you
> to the map (win/catch clears it; cleared ones respawn over time via a
> `RESPAWN_CHANCE` roll — `src/world/config.js`, `DECISIONS.md` #61; fleeing
> leaves it), catching or beating one earns real XP, and The Meadows is stocked
> with its real 14-line wild-roster slice (⚠️ Lewis's rename pass still
> pending). **On to M4** — its architecture is now planned in
> `PLANS/M4_WORLD_SYSTEMS_PLAN.md` (produced from the M4 peer-review
> checkpoint + a paired code review). **Next: M4 Step 1 (Tokens).**

| Step | What we build | ▶ You'll see |
|---|---|---|
| **M3S1** ✅ | Add **Phaser** + a game canvas from a real Tuxemon tileset (+ a `CREDITS.md` row, per `CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` §15); wire a temporary **"Battle test" button** so the M1/M2 battle stays reachable until the M3S7 handoff | A colored game canvas above the old battle — *done!* |
| **M3S2** ✅ | Draw **The Meadows** tile map from the real tile art | A meadow with a path and a tree border — *done!* |
| **M3S3** ✅ | A **player character** you walk with the **arrow keys**, four directions, tile by tile; trees/edges block you — real Tuxemon walk-sheet (+ a `CREDITS.md` row) | Walk the meadow with real character art — *done!* |
| **M3S4** ✅ | **Walk animation** — the hero's legs move as you walk | Walking looks like walking — *done!* |
| **M3S5** ✅ | The **sprite-slicer tool** — cut creature sheets into front/back/idle poses (done at M3S0 for the 3 starters; the full-roster slice is M3S11 / M4) | New sliced sprite files, no gameplay change — *done!* |
| **M3S6** ✅ | **Wild Fakeamon stand on the map** — creatures idle in the grass; walking into one bumps it (a console message for now; the real battle is M3S7) | A wild Fakeamon idling in the grass; bump it → a message — *done! (2026-07-11)* |
| **M3S7** ✅ | **The handoff** 🌉 — walk into a wild Fakeamon → the real battle opens (a tiny `src/screens.js` hides + freezes the map) → win/catch/flee → back on the map (creature gone unless you fled) | Touch the creature → the M1/M2 battle → back on the map — *done! (2026-07-11)* |
| **M3S8** ✅ | **Outcome depth** — a catch on the map joins your team; real XP (win = full, catch = half); and wild Fakeamon now **respawn over time** instead of staying gone (Jeff's call, overriding this row's old wording) | Catch a wild Leafick on the map, see it join the team and earn XP — and if you clear one out, it may wander back later — *done! (2026-07-12)* |
| **M3S9** ✅ | **Cleanup + docs** — removed the temporary "Battle test" button/bar and its now-dead code (`runBattleTest`, `fightRandomWildFakeamon`, `updateTestBar`, `pickRandomWildSpeciesKey`); checked for stale `M3 PLACEHOLDER` comments (the one that exists, the M4-loss placeholder, is still genuinely a placeholder — left as-is); verified the full title→walk→battle→win→save/reload loop plays start-to-finish with zero page errors | A tiny but complete monster-catching game — *done! (2026-07-12)* |
| **M3S10** ✅ | **Play it on a tablet ("Pocket Venta")** — an on-screen D-pad + fit-to-screen scaling, so The Meadows is walkable with your thumbs (`PLANS/M3_TOUCH_AND_MOBILE_PLAN.md`) | Walk the meadow with your thumbs — *done! (2026-07-12)* |
| **M3S11** ✅ | **Expand the wild roster** — swapped The Meadows' 3-starter test pool for its real 14-line slice of the approved **198-Fakeamon** pool (`CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` §16, `VENTA_ROSTER_DRAFT.md`); stats from a `[TUNE]` per-type archetype table (`src/data/fakeamon.js`), sprites sliced (`tools/slice-sheets.mjs`), 14 spread across the open grass. ⚠️ **Lewis's Tuxemon-slug → Fakeamon rename pass is still pending** — names are Title-Cased slugs (clear placeholders) since only he can pick the real ones; nothing here guesses on his behalf. *Beyond the core plan; built after M3S10* | The Meadows fills up with a proper cast — *done! (2026-07-12, renames pending Lewis)* |

**🎉 M3 done when:** you explore a map, meet a visible wild Fakeamon — a real
Meadows cast, not just the starters — battle it, and return to exploring.

> **🎒 The rest of the pool comes area-by-area:** M3S11 wires in only **The
> Meadows'** slice, because The Meadows is the one map M3 builds. The other five
> Venta areas (B8 — The Forest, Foggy City, Snow Mountain, The Factory, The
> Lagoon) each get their own slice of the 198-Fakeamon pool **as they open** —
> and since Snow Mountain / The Factory / The Lagoon only unlock via gym badges
> (B14), that can't be one step. So **M4S6** opens and stocks the **first**
> badge-gated area (The Lagoon), and the job **carries on through M5** for the
> rest — no longer "unscheduled," just paced to when each area actually gets
> built (`PLANS/M4_WORLD_SYSTEMS_PLAN.md` §5/§7). The art and
> licensing for the whole pool is already staged (`CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` §16);
> what lands per area is the creative wiring — Lewis's renames, encounter
> tables, and stats.

## 🟡 M4 — World Systems (places to visit)  *(in progress — Steps 1–3 done; Step 4 (Gym 1) next)*

**Goal:** reasons to explore — heal, shop, cook, and the first trainer
challenge. *(Beating a gym opens a new area — Step 6 builds that area-travel
seam and stocks the **first** new area; the remaining areas follow in M5.)*
Architecture: `PLANS/M4_WORLD_SYSTEMS_PLAN.md`.

> **Status (2026-07-24):** **Steps 1–3 are done.** **Step 1 (Tokens)** — you
> earn 🪙 tokens for winning a wild battle, shown in a HUD counter; the tunable
> numbers live in the new `src/data/economy.js`. That session also folded in
> the **S0 groundwork** the plan front-loads (§2, §8): **save v2** — new
> `tokens` / `flags` / `inventory.berries` fields with a v1→v2 migration and
> defensive back-fills — plus three pre-M4 fixes: the live **CR-A** bug (beaten
> wild Fakeamon no longer reappear after Continue, closing the reload XP-farm —
> via a scene-resync seam M4S6 will reuse), **CR-C** type colors for
> normal/metal creatures, and a service-worker cache bump. **Step 2
> (Fakeatent)** — a building tile in The Meadows you bump to open a heal panel
> (10 🪙 for a full-team heal, Lewis & Jeff's call); the map stays visible
> behind the panel (a HUD overlay, not a battle takeover, per plan §5.1). It
> also **replaces the old M3 loss placeholder**: a whole-team wipe now sends you
> to the Fakeatent (healed, minus `TEAM_WIPE_TOKEN_LOSS` tokens, floored at
> zero) instead of the map's plain start tile. Real art landed for the tent
> mid-session (Jeff's own AI-generated sprite, background fixed in GIMP) — see
> `CREDITS.md`'s "Original art" section. **Step 3 (Tall Tower)** — a second
> building right beside the Fakeatent; bump it to open a shop panel and buy
> Fakeaballs for 5 🪙 each (`BALL_COST`) into the same count the catch button
> already reads. Unlike the Fakeatent's one-and-done Rest, buying **stays in
> the shop** so you can buy several in one visit, closer to how a real shop
> works. Only the basic Fakeaball is sold (Lewis's B18/#31) — Great/Ultra/Cosmic
> are still a later feature. Real Tuxemon ball-tier art was also sourced this
> session (all 4 tiers, `assets/sprites/items/`); only the basic Fakeaball's
> icon is wired in (on both the catch button and the shop's Buy button) — the
> other three are vendored and credited, staged for whenever the tier mechanics
> get built. ⚠️ **Placeholder art** — the Tall Tower itself still draws as a
> colored marker (no real building sprite sourced yet; swap-in spot:
> `BUILDING_ART`/`BUILDING_LOOKS` in `src/world/config.js`). **Next: Step 4
> (Gym 1)** — the first engine change (an enemy party) plus a metal move.

| Step | What we build | ▶ You'll see |
|---|---|---|
| **1** ✅ | **Tokens** — earn them from winning battles; show a token counter *(landed with the S0 groundwork: save v2, the CR-A Continue fix, and CR-C type colors)* | A number that goes up when you win — *done! (2026-07-24)* |
| **2** ✅ | **Fakeatent** — step on it to **heal your whole team** to full (costs tokens); also replaces the M3 team-wipe placeholder as home base | A tent building; HP refills — *done! (2026-07-24, real art — Jeff's own AI-generated tent, background fixed in GIMP)* |
| **3** ✅ | **Tall Tower** — spend tokens to **buy Fakeaballs** | A shop; your ball count goes up — *done! (2026-07-24, placeholder building art; real Fakeaball icon on the Buy button)* |
| **4** | **Gym 1** — a trainer NPC with a **2-Fakeamon team** (a standard + a stronger ace); beating them gives tokens | Talk to the leader → a two-creature trainer battle |
| **5** | **Cooking Cabin** — combine berries into **healing dishes** (recipes heal different amounts); self-serve, walk in and cook (B26). *Moved here from M5 — it's a world system, not part of the story* | A cooking screen; recipes that heal different amounts |
| **6** | **Open a new area** — build the **area-travel seam** (walk between maps through doorways), so Gym 1's **Gear Badge** opens **one** new area (**The Lagoon**), stocked with its own slice of the **198-Fakeamon** pool + Lewis's renames (`CONTENT_REFERENCE.md` §16, `VENTA_ROSTER_DRAFT.md`). *(Re-scoped from an open-ended "all areas" job: the remaining four areas grow area-by-area in **M5** as their paths open — `PLANS/M4_WORLD_SYSTEMS_PLAN.md` §5/§7.)* | Beat Gym 1 → walk through the opened gate into a new area with its own fresh cast of wild Fakeamon |

**🎉 M4 done when:** you can win tokens, heal at a Fakeatent, buy balls at a
Tall Tower, beat your first gym, cook healing dishes at a Cooking Cabin, and
walk through the badge-opened gate into **one** new area stocked with its own
wild Fakeamon. *(The remaining areas open, one at a time, in M5.)*

---

## 🔴 M5 — Depth & Story (the finale)

**Goal:** the big finish — evolutions, the mini-bosses, and stopping Artemis.
*(New late-game areas keep getting their own wild-roster slice — the same
area-by-area job M4 Step 6 begins with the first area, now carried through the
rest of Venta.)*

| Step | What we build | ▶ You'll see |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Evolutions** — a Fakeamon that reaches its evolve level gets a **new sprite + higher stats** | "Growler is evolving!" with new art |
| **2** | The **5 mini-bosses** (single strong encounters) placed in the world | Tough special battles worth big XP |
| **3** | **"Beat all 5 → unlock Artemis"** gate | A locked area that opens once all five are down |
| **4** | **Artemis finale** — the legendary boss with **Meteor Shower** (hits your Fakeamon **and** damages Artemis itself — Lewis's idea!) | An epic, huge-HP battle that's hard but winnable |
| **5** | **Win screen** — beat Artemis, stop the meteor 🌠 | "You saved the Fakeamon world!" |

**🎉 M5 done when:** you can evolve creatures, clear all 5 mini-bosses, and
defeat Artemis to win the game.

---

## Decisions to make *when we get there*

The full question bank is **`HOMEWORK_BACKLOG.md`** (B1–B42). **All of it is
now decided** — Lewis cleared B1–B32 (2026-07-06) and the last ten, B33–B42,
on 2026-07-11 (see `DECISIONS.md` rows 14–45 and 51–60, folded into
`DESIGN.md`). The last ten: swap boxed Fakeamon at a **Fakeatent** (B33); the
wild opponent reads **"the wild ‹name›"** in battle text (B34); berries are
**themed by area** (B35); a **smaller starter Cooking Cabin** exists too (B36);
the **Venta wild-roster area draft is approved as-is** (B37); and the touch
D-pad is **four floating arrows, bottom-right, half see-through, with a
show/hide toggle**, still named **"Pocket Venta"** (B38–B42).

What's left is **only Jeff's number-tuning** (not creative calls, just math):
evolution levels per starter, the XP curve, exact Great/Ultra/Cosmic ball
multipliers, token prices (feel is decided — B16), and the Gym 2/3 ace
re-theme/swap (Windeye, Spectera).

*(Every creative-director question B1–B42 is decided — see `DECISIONS.md`.)*

*Slice-first: each milestone is playable before we start the next one.
Small steps, keep it fun.* 🎮
